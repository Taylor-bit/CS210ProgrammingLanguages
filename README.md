# CS-210 Projects and Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains the assignments and projects for CS-210, covering modules 1 through 7. The primary focus is on Project 3, a C++-based Sales Tracker application. This application was created to address the issue of efficiently recording sales data for various things by allowing the user to view total sales, frequency of a given item, and a visual representation of sales in the form of a histogram.

### What Problem Was It Solving?

Project 3 addresses the need to organize and analyze sales data in an user-friendly manner. The application reads sales data from a file, converts it to a structured format, and gives the user several ways to query and display the data. This is especially important for organizations that need to monitor sales patterns and inventory levels.

### What Did I Do Particularly Well?

One of the project's strengths is the adoption of current C++ techniques, such as smart pointers ('make_unique'), which improved memory management and prevented memory leaks. Additionally, user input validation and exception handling were included to increase the program's robustness, ensuring that erroneous inputs are handled gracefully.

### Where Could I Enhance My Code?

The code might be improved in various ways. For example, implementing encryption or authentication procedures could improve the security of sales data. Optimizing the file reading process by buffering larger chunks of data at once could also help the software run more efficiently. Furthermore, splitting the menu navigation and user input routines into separate classes or modules would make the code more modular and maintainable.

### What Was Most Challenging?

The most difficult aspect of the project was managing file input and ensuring that the program correctly parsed and processed the data into a usable format. To address this, I used intensive testing and debugging techniques, as well as resources such as C++ manuals and community forums. These technologies proved invaluable additions to my support network, assisting me in navigating complicated situations.

### Transferable Skills

This project improved various abilities that will be valuable in future coursework and projects, including file I/O operations, string manipulation, and the use of C++ standard libraries like'map' and 'fstream'. Furthermore, learning how to organize a program to handle diverse user inputs and outputs is a skill that will serve you well in subsequent software development projects.

### How Did I Make the Program Maintainable?

To make the program more maintainable, I focused on producing clean, legible code. This includes using descriptive variable names, splitting down functionality into well-defined methods, and commenting on critical areas of code. By arranging the code logically and employing modern C++ principles, the program becomes more flexible to future changes or upgrades.
